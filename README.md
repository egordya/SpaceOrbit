<br>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
Issue: After building a level (or adding an object to a customly built level), you are currently not able to edit or delete the level.<br>
Solution: Should you still want to edit your Custom Built Level, you can open the json file with your level name in a text editor and change parameters. <br>
